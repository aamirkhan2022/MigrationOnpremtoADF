# Metadata-driven Incremental Data Load from On-Prem SQL to Azure 🚀



## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **metadata-driven incremental data pipeline** that migrates data from an **on-premises SQL Server** to **Azure Cloud** using modern Azure data engineering services.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Traditional full data loads from on-prem systems:
- Are time-consuming
- Consume high resources
- Are not scalable

This project solves the problem by implementing:
- Incremental data loads
- Watermark-based logic
- Metadata-driven configuration

---

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture
**Data Flow:**

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- On-Prem SQL Server
- Azure SQL / Data Lake
- SQL (Incremental & Watermark Logic)
- JSON (Metadata Configuration)
- GitHub (Version Control)

---

## 📂 Repository Structure


---

## 🔑 Key Features
- Metadata-driven pipeline design
- Incremental load using watermark logic
- Reusable and scalable ADF pipelines
- Separation of configuration and logic
- Version-controlled code using GitHub

---

## 📊 Use Case
This solution can be used in real-world scenarios where:
- Legacy on-prem databases need to be migrated to Azure
- Daily or hourly incremental data loads are required
- Data is consumed by BI tools like Power BI
